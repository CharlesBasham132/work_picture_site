 1.1.1 Background

    The problem trying to be solved is that of communication, specifiacally of those in and working in care environments. In a carer setting (typically involving elderly people or people who suffer from learning difficulties who have trouble with speech, hearing or language barriers) devices such as talking boards or communication cards are commonly used. Whilst these are useful aids, they do not provide the audio functionality communication to the carer. They also do not provide the practicality and portability of a wesite based application.

    An example where the 'speak easy' website provides an advantage over communication cards:
    A mute, elderly patient wants to get the attention of a carer as he is thirsty. With the website he can simply click on the bell icon to notify the carer. Then he can click the 'thirsty' picture and the device will speak aloud that he is thirsty. The carer can also ask simple yes/no questions that the patient can answer with the 'yes' and 'no' buttons.
    With more complex requests and answers the carer can make use of the 'talking board' section of the website to point at letter characters.
    This is an improvement over phrase communication cards as the patient can audiable attract the attention of the carer. Also the website can be used by multiple people simultaniously without the need for additional packs of physical cards.

 1.1.3 Colour Choices

    The colour choices were chosen with a functionable use in mind. With colour bllindness effecting 1 in 12 males, it was decided that the bold, easily distinguishable colours would be used instead of going for a multi-shaded artistic approach. 
    The aqua blue body background was chosen as it does not match any of the images used and so will not cause confusion. It was a specific design choice not to include any fancy patterns or images for the backgrounds of the pages as this might casuse confusion and also does not add any functional usability to the website.

 1.1.4 Accessilility

    To limit language barrier inteference, there was a design choice taken to put a greater empasis on visual images than words as these are universally understandable. According the the carersuk.org report there are over 500,000 BAME carers working in England. With such a ethnically diverse industry it is important to accomadeate design choices to cater to language barriers as they are going to be an obstacle more frequently than with other industries.

    Images were resized and reduced from their original size to make sure that the page would load faster. This benifits those using the site with slower internet connections.

    The main page can be operated fairly easily with the use of the 'tab' and 'shift+tab' keys. This perhaps would aide people who lack the motorary functions to use a mouse. This is especially important given the target demographic users of the website.

    All images within the site are supplied with 'equivalent alternative text' to aid visually impared users who can use screen reading software such as 'JAWS' and 'Dolphin Screen Reader'



 1.2.5 GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

    The website will need to adhere to both the 'Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018)' and also the 'General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

    The only section of the website that has the potential to store people's personal data is the 'contact' page. This is with the use of the form contact. The form does not include any back end database storing of information at the moment, however if it did then the name and email adress contact information would definatly be covered by the DPA 2018.
    The contact information would only be able to be used within the confines of answering the user's questions and querys. The data would not be allowed to be sold to a third party company for marketing purposes.


 1.2.6 Distance Selling

    If the 'Speak Easy' website were to be launched as a business venture then the financial strategy would probably focus on advertising revenue streams such as 'Google AdSense' or 'Mediavine' instead of payment to acess the website itself. This would allow all consumers to use the software free of charge.
    However if the decision was made to provide a pay per use method then the site would have to adhere to the 
    'online distance selling act'.
    There would be an exception to the rules if the price of acess is less than the sum of Â£42 which seems likely that it would be less than this ammount. However it is important to recognize that the product could potentialy be sold as a 'whole-sale' product to care homes and even hospitals which would permit them a large number of user accounts avaiable to use the application. 

 1.2.7 Evaluation

    Tackling the problem of communication in those in care.


    Problems encountered:
    There were many unforseen problems within the development stage of the project.

    One such example was a the implementation of audio with the use of javascript. It was difficult to implement this functionality in the sepperate script file and so the script was left embedded within the index.html document.
    
    Another problem was with layout of the buttons on the homepage. The original design was to have all of the available images within view when you enter the site. This would allow for the user to select every image without scrolling down. It was difficult to achieve a layout like this as the buttons would not place within the images of the second row.

    Design choices:
        The choice of a 'minimilist' design is prevalent through out the whole of the website. This means there are not too many objects or blocks of text cluttering the user interface. The site strives to provides a clean, percise functional purpose first instead of relaying artistic elements or information at its forefront. The minimalist function follows form approach was inspired partly by the bauhaus architectural movement which is commonplace in recent user interface design trends. If the website was of a different nature such as a self promotion portfolio then the styling would have differed to accomodate more interesting more soulful artistic qualities.

    Improvements for the future:
    The site works functionably well and achieves what it was set out to do. However there are a few additions and alterations that would improve the site if further development were to take place:
        An additional settings page would be an important addition to the website. This would allow such userbility functions such as changing the voice to a female and a dark colour layout mode. Other additional settings could include changing the size of the images to assist those who are visually impared, and an option to add a users own personal image cards to the home screen.

        Improve the responsiveness of the website.

        Production of a smartphone / tablet application version of the website. This would improve accessibility and improve compatibility.
        
        Messaging functionality so the user and carer can communicate with each other even if they are in different locations.
        
        Being able to quickly change volume in the window via a fader widget would improve the user experience.

        Creation of a custom larger pointer cursor so the 'talking board' page would perfom better. Another feature that would improve the page would be the ability for the user to click on letters to make a word / short message that a carer would be able to view. This would be used for more complex / unique questions not covered by the generic images on the websites home page (index.html) Furthermore a setting could be implemented to change the style of the board to resemble an 'eye gaze communication board'.

        It is also worth noting that the design concept has a large scope for improvement and further development with the implementation of eye tracking software as this becomes a better and more reliable technology over time.
